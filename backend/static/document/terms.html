It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the DeGPT secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that the DeGPT won’t work properly or at all.</span>

As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the DeGPT, or other third-party charges. In using the DeGPT, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the DeGPT outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the DeGPT, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the DeGPT.</span>

In some countries there are specific time periods to cancel online purchases after purchasing them provided by law (European Union residents etc). For these countries, consumers may have a right to cancel in specific number of days after purchasing products/services online provided by law. Therefore, your right to cancel in-app purchases will rely on the country you reside in. Since payment processes of certain purchases on DeGPT Apps will be conducted by the mobile platform owner, failure to follow certain local laws regulating right to cancel will be subject to mobile platform owners’ terms. Please also review the mobile platform owner’s terms in this regard before purchase. You can find further information on cancelling orders and any associated refunds on the website of the third-party re-seller from whom you purchased the app (the Apple App Store and/or Google Play). Where you purchase from DeGPT directly: please note and acknowledge that if you are a resident in the European Union or your local law regulates a right to cancel and download the DeGPT Apps from DeGPT directly, you agree to waive your cancellation and refund right once the download of the app or the relevant purchase is made. Please note that if you are not a resident in the European Union and if your local laws do not regulate mandatory laws otherwise, you have already no right to cancel purchases you made if you download DeGPT Apps from DeGPT directly. This means that you will not be able to cancel your order or obtain a refund once the download and delivery of the app is complete. This will also apply to subscriptions and in-app purchases.
